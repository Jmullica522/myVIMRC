# README

I don't know what you're expecting to read here. It's a vimrc file for myself with bare minimal functionality at the moment.

**Expected Growth**: 
- HTML Specific functionality such as auto inserting tags
- CSS Specific (see HTML)
- JavaScript Specific Functionality, I really have no idea for this part yet...
- AutoSave and backups!!!
